# Behavior tests for the worktree-tangle guards.
#
# Firstmate uses registered direct Git worktrees: linked worktrees and
# secondmate homes sit at a detached HEAD on the default branch, while the
# PRIMARY checkout (FM_ROOT) is a normal checkout on a real branch. The "tangle"
# is a crewmate branching/committing in the primary instead of its own worktree,
# stranding the primary on a feature branch. Two guards cover it:
#   GUARD 1 (prevention) - the brief asserts isolation before its branch step, and
#            fm-spawn refuses to launch unless the resolved worktree is isolated.
#   GUARD 2 (detection)  - fm-guard and fm-bootstrap alarm when the primary is on
#            a feature branch, and stay silent on the default branch or detached.
# These cases pin: the shared lib's branch classification, the fm-guard banner,
# the fm-bootstrap problem line, the brief assertion ordering, and the fm-spawn
# abort - all hermetic over temp git repos and fakebins.

# assertions pin the command construction deterministically, with no live tmux:
#   - window creation targets the session with a trailing colon (append form), so
#     tmux appends at the next free index instead of the active window index, which
#     collides under base-index 1;
#   - the window id is captured (-P -F #{window_id}) and automatic-rename/allow-rename
#     are disabled so the fm-<id> name survives the harness launch;
#   - the backend starts directly in the provider-created worktree, never in the
